# React To-Do List

A simple and interactive to-do list application built with React. This project demonstrates basic React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and event handling.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Mark Complete**: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persist Data**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` to persist data across page reloads (if implemented).

## Demo

## Usage

1. **Adding a task**:
   - Enter the task description in the input field.
   - Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the task to the list.

2. **Marking a task as complete/incomplete**:
   - Click the checkbox next to the task description to toggle its completion status.

3. **Deleting a task**:
   - Click the "Delete" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

## Customization

You can customize the app by modifying the components or adding new features. Here are a few ideas:
- **Edit Tasks**: Implement functionality to edit existing tasks.
- **Filter Tasks**: Add filters to show all tasks, only completed tasks, or only incomplete tasks.
- **Animations**: Use CSS animations or a library like `react-transition-group` to add animations for adding and removing tasks.
